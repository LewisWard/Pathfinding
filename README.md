# AI Pathfinding Demo README #

### How do I get set up? ###

The project can be created using CMake, from within the 'AIDemo' directory. The project was created using Visual Studio 2015 and SDL2, so it is recommended that you use Visual Studio 2015.

Debug and Release modes have the correct SDL lib's created in order to run. The .exe that are built can be found within the Bin directory.
